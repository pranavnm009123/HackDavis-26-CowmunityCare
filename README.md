# CowmunityCare

> Accessible community intake for healthcare, housing, hunger, and everyday help.

CowmunityCare helps people ask for support in the way that works for them: speech, ASL/sign language through video, or simple form details. Staff receive a structured intake record with urgency, accessibility needs, resource matches, and next steps.

Built for **HackDavis 2026** with an Aggie-inspired name and a care-first experience.

---

## Product Summary

CowmunityCare is a real-time intake system for clinics, shelters, food programs, and community support teams.

Patient-facing flow:

1. A person opens `/patient`.
2. They choose one of four help categories:
   - **Healthcare**
   - **Housing**
   - **Hunger**
   - **Here-to-Help**
3. They choose **Speech** or **ASL / Sign Language**.
4. The assistant asks one short question at a time.
5. The system creates a staff-ready record.

Staff-facing flow:

1. Staff open `/staff`.
2. Intake cards appear live.
3. Urgency alerts surface immediately.
4. Staff can update intake status, review appointments, manage facilities/doctors, and view analytics.

Core headline:

> Say it, sign it, share it — Care starts with being understood.

## Key Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Speech intake | Streams browser audio to Gemini Live and receives spoken responses. |
| ASL / sign-language intake | Uses video frames and timed signing windows so users can respond visually. |
| Four help categories | Healthcare, Housing, Hunger, and Here-to-Help share the same pipeline but collect different fields. |
| Live staff queue | New structured cards broadcast to staff over WebSocket. |
| Urgency alerts | Critical or high-risk signals are broadcast immediately before the intake is complete. |
| Structured case records | Claude normalizes raw intake data into a staff-facing JSON card. |
| Resource matching | Local resources are matched from curated data, optional Backboard RAG, and access scoring. |
| Accessibility-first UI | Keyboard focus, skip link, semantic landmarks, live regions, labels, reduced-motion support, and high-contrast palette. |
| Appointments | Staff can view, complete, cancel, add doctors, add facilities, and manage availability. |
| Analytics | Intake volume, urgency mix, modes, languages, appointments, and category trends. |

---

## Help Categories

The frontend uses friendly public labels. The backend keeps stable internal mode ids so existing server logic continues to work.

| Public label | Internal mode | Collects |
|---|---|---|
| Healthcare | `clinic` | Symptoms, duration, severity, red flags, insurance/cost concern, accessibility needs, interpreter needs, support contact. |
| Housing | `shelter` | Housing status, safety, timeline, family size, pets, budget, mobility needs, location, contact method. |
| Hunger | `food_aid` | Household size, location, dietary restrictions, transport limits, requested supplies, urgency, accessibility needs. |
| Here-to-Help | `support_services` | Type of help needed, location, mobility, language, transportation, cost concern, support contact, reachable options. |

Here-to-Help is access-first: it focuses on whether a person can actually reach a useful service, considering language, mobility, transportation, and known barriers.

## Accessibility Approach

CowmunityCare is designed for people who may be Deaf or hard of hearing, blind or low vision, speech-impaired or nonspeaking, multilingual, or navigating stressful circumstances.

Implemented UI accessibility work:

- Native buttons, inputs, selects, and links.
- Visible keyboard focus rings.
- Skip link to main content.
- Semantic page landmarks with `main` and labeled navigation.
- Screen-reader labels for filters, search, fields, camera preview, charts, and actions.
- `aria-live`, `role="status"`, and `role="alert"` for dynamic connection, loading, error, and speaking states.
- `aria-pressed` for selected filters and category choices.
- Reduced-motion fallback with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Blue/gold/white palette with WCAG AA contrast checks for key text pairs.
- Text transcript bubbles for spoken and signed interactions.

Important: this is not a legal accessibility certification. Before deployment, test manually with keyboard-only navigation, VoiceOver/NVDA, browser zoom at 200-400%, mobile touch, Deaf/ASL users, and blind/low-vision users.

## How ASL / Sign Language Intake Works

1. The patient chooses **ASL / Sign Language**.
2. The client starts the Gemini session with `languagePreference: "sign_language"`.
3. The camera turns on and sends JPEG frames every second.
4. The assistant asks exactly one short question.
5. The client waits for the signing window.
6. The client sends a text cue asking Gemini to interpret the recent signing.
7. The transcript shows captured signed responses as chat bubbles.
8. On finalize, the server creates a pending staff follow-up appointment for ASL intakes.

ASL prompt rules intentionally avoid repeated questions and multi-question turns.

---

## Resource Matching

CowmunityCare uses several resource layers:

1. Static fallback resources in `server/functions.js`.
2. Facility and access metadata from MongoDB.
3. Optional Backboard RAG enrichment using `server/data/yolo_resources.md`.

Here-to-Help uses `check_resource_access` to score reachable facilities against needs such as:

- wheelchair access
- ASL or language interpreter support
- transportation availability
- proximity to the patient city
- known staff-reported barriers

---

## Staff Workflow

Open `/staff`.

Staff can:

- review live intake cards
- filter by category, urgency, status, and search text
- switch grid/list layout
- dismiss urgency alerts
- mark cards reviewed, referred, or resolved

Open `/staff/appointments`.

Staff can:

- view bot-confirmed appointments
- complete or cancel appointments
- add doctors
- add facilities
- add appointment slots
- review facility networks

Open `/staff/analytics`.

Staff can review:

- intake volume over time
- appointment count
- urgency breakdown
- category breakdown
- languages spoken
- housing and hunger-specific metrics

---

## Design System Notes

Current brand:

- Product: **CowmunityCare**
- Tagline: **Accessible Community Intake**
- Main categories: **Healthcare**, **Housing**, **Hunger**, **Here-to-Help**
- Palette: UC Davis-inspired navy blue, gold, and white

Current patient page copy:

```text
Accessible intake for healthcare, housing, hunger, and everyday help — speak, sign, or share what you need.
```

```text
Say it, sign it, share it — Care starts with being understood.
```

The UI intentionally avoids making AI the lead message. The product promise is understanding, access, and staff-ready next steps.

---

## Known Limitations

- The product is not a medical diagnostic tool.
- The app can escalate urgent warning signs but does not replace emergency services.
- ASL interpretation depends on camera quality, lighting, user framing, and model performance.
- Accessibility implementation still needs real assistive-tech and user testing before deployment.
- Some backend logs and internal prompts may still use the older VoiceBridge name. The website-facing UI is CowmunityCare.
- MongoDB is required for durable storage. Without it, live WebSocket behavior can still run, but persistence will fail.

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before demo or deployment:

1. Create `.env` with required API keys.
2. Confirm MongoDB connection.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Run `cd client && npm run lint`.
5. Start server with `npm run dev:server`.
6. Start client with `npm run dev:client`.
7. Test `/patient` Speech flow.
8. Test `/patient` ASL / Sign Language flow.
9. Open `/staff` in another browser and verify live cards.
10. Verify `/staff/appointments` and `/staff/analytics`.
11. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader basics.

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

If the client starts on `5174` instead of `5173`:

```text
Port 5173 was already in use. Use the URL Vite prints.
```

If the server fails to create a Gemini session:

```text
Check GEMINI_API_KEY in .env.
```

If structured cards fail:

```text
Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env.
```

If cards do not persist:

```text
Check MONGODB_URI and MongoDB network access.
```

If emails do not send:

```text
Configure SMTP_* variables or use the Ethereal test-account logs.
```

If resource enrichment does not run:

```text
Set BACKBOARD_API_KEY and BACKBOARD_ASSISTANT_ID.
```
